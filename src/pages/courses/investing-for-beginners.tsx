          1. Understanding Investing
        </h2>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-600">
          Investing is the process of allocating money into assets with the
          expectation of generating income or capital appreciation over time.
          The goal is to build wealth gradually by taking on varying levels of
          risk and making informed decisions.

          2. Why Should You Invest?
        </h2>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-lg text-gray-600">
          <li>
            <strong>Wealth Building:</strong> Investing allows you to build
            wealth beyond just saving money in a bank account.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Retirement Planning:</strong> The earlier you start
            investing, the more you can benefit from compound interest (the
            interest you earn on interest).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Inflation Hedge:</strong> Inflation erodes purchasing power,
            but investments (like stocks and real estate) can help your money
            grow at a pace faster than inflation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Financial Goals:</strong> Whether it&apos;s buying a home,
            starting a business, or paying for a child&apos;s education,
            investing helps achieve long-term financial goals.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">3. Types of Investments</h2>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">a. Stocks</h3>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <strong>What is a Stock?</strong> A stock represents ownership in a
          company. When you buy a share of stock, you&apos;re purchasing a small part
          of that company.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <strong>How Stocks Work:</strong> The value of your shares can go up
          (capital appreciation) or down, depending on the company&apos;s
          performance and broader market conditions.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <strong>Dividends:</strong> Some stocks pay a portion of their profits
          to shareholders, typically quarterly. These are called dividends.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-6">
          <strong>Types of Stocks:</strong> Common Stocks (with voting rights
          and potential dividends), and Preferred Stocks (with priority for
          dividends but no voting rights).
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">b. Bonds</h3>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <strong>What is a Bond?</strong> A bond is a type of debt investment
          where you lend money to a government, corporation, or organization in
          exchange for regular interest payments (coupons) and repayment of the
          principal when the bond matures.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-6">
          <strong>How Bonds Work:</strong> Bonds are generally considered safer
          than stocks, though the return is typically lower. Bonds are
          classified by their credit rating.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">c. Mutual Funds</h3>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <strong>What is a Mutual Fund?</strong> A mutual fund pools money from
          many investors to buy a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or
          other securities.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-6">
          <strong>Types of Mutual Funds:</strong> Equity Funds (focus on
          stocks), Bond Funds (focus on bonds), Index Funds (track a market
          index), Target-Date Funds (adjust asset allocation based on retirement
          timeline).
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">
          d. Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)
        </h3>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <strong>What is an ETF?</strong> ETFs are similar to mutual funds but
          are traded like stocks on the stock exchange. They typically have
          lower fees than mutual funds.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">e. Real Estate</h3>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <strong>Investing in Property:</strong> Buying residential or
          commercial properties to earn rental income or capital appreciation.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-6">
          <strong>Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs):</strong> A way to
          invest in real estate without buying physical property. REITs pay
          dividends from property rental income.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">f. Commodities</h3>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <strong>What are Commodities?</strong> Commodities are raw materials
          like gold, oil, or agricultural products. Investors can buy
          commodities directly or invest in funds that track commodity prices.

          4. Risk and Return: Understanding the Relationship
        </h2>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-lg text-gray-600">
          <li>
            <strong>Risk:</strong> Every investment comes with riskâ€”the
            potential for losing money. Risk is typically higher in assets like
            stocks and lower in bonds.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Return:</strong> This is the profit or loss on an investment
            over time. Generally, the higher the potential return, the higher
            the risk.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Risk Tolerance:</strong> Assess your comfort level with
            risk. Younger investors can typically afford higher risk (since they
            have more time to recover from losses), while older investors might
            prefer safer, more stable investments.
          </li>

      <section className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">5. Portfolio Management</h2>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-4">
          A portfolio is a collection of your investments, including stocks,
          bonds, and other assets. Good portfolio management aims to balance
          risk and reward according to your financial goals.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">a. Diversification</h3>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-4">
          <strong>What is Diversification?</strong> Diversification involves
          spreading your investments across different asset classes (stocks,
          bonds, real estate, etc.) to reduce risk. By holding different types
          of investments, the negative performance of one asset class can be
          offset by the positive performance of another.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">b. Asset Allocation</h3>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-6">
          <strong>What is Asset Allocation?</strong> Asset allocation refers to
          how you divide your investments among different asset classes. A
          typical asset allocation might include 60% stocks, 30% bonds, and 10%
          cash.
